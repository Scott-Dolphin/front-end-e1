                Growing up, my family has always been centered around food
                and meals. My dad taught me how to cook from age 11,
                starting with a very simple chicken fried rice. Since then,
                I've worked at two restaurants, ranging from running food,
                prep, and grilling chicken on the hot line. While it's been
                a year since my previous kitchen job, I still regularly 
                cook for myself and friends.

                This is a chicken tikka masala i made for my family.
                As a taiwanese family, we only ever ate japanese style
                curry growing up, so I made everyone try this to give
                them a different experience with curry. This was one of
                my first experiences learning a recipe by myself, so 
                when it turned out the way it did, I was very, VERY pleased
                with myself.

                This one's a kimchi & spare rib grilled cheese I came up
                with when I was hungry at 3 in the morning. While the 
                ingredients may sound kinda weird at first, it actually
                turned out really tasty. The spare ribs I used were slow
                braised in soy sauce for several hours, so after cooking
                for that long, they were easily pulled apart and mixed
                perfectly with the fried kimchi and cheese.

                This last dish is probably my finest culinary achivement.
                I came up with this little hors d'oeurve for Mother's day
                this year. Originally, I wanted to do a steak and uni
                rice bowl for  the family, but after realising how boring
                that could be, I decided I wanted to do something a bit
                fancier. In the end, I went with tik tok's accordion fries
                as a base, topped with a layer of roast garlic chimmichurri
                and some medium well ribeye. Finally, the whole bite is 
                topped off with a piece of uni and garnished with some more
                chimmichuri.
